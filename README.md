# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.

## Features

* Custom Voice: Utilize EleventLabs to create a unique voice for your AI model.
* Connected to Telegram: Directly send and receive messages from your AI companion via Telegram.
* Personality: Customize the AI's personality according to your preferences.
* Selfies: AI is capable of generating SELFIES when asked.

## Getting started 

To run your companion locally:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
ship serve local
```

To deploy your companion & connect it to Telegram:

```
pip install steamship
ship serve remote
```

You will need to fetch a Telegram key to connect your companion to Telegram. [This guide](/docs/register-telegram-bot.md) will show you how.


## Roadmap
* Memories: Soon, the AI will have the capability to remember past interactions, improving conversational context and depth.
* Photorealistic selfies

  <br>
Do you have a unique personality in mind for our AI model, GirlfriendGPT? Great! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to add it.


##start the hacking point withe the puython 2;00
##ctrl.url point 
## Step 1: Define Your Personality
First, you'll need to define your personality. This is done by creating a new Python file in the src/personalities directory.

For example, if your personality is named "jane", you would create a file called `jane.json`. Inside this file, you would define the characteristics and behaviors that embody "jane". This could include her speaking style, responses to certain inputs, or any other defining features you envision.

## Step 2: Test and Submit

Before you submit your new personality, please test it to ensure everything works as expected. If all is well, submit a Pull Request with your changes, and be sure to include the title "{name} - {description}" where {name} is your personality's name, and {description} is a brief explanation of the personality.

Good luck, and we can't wait to meet your new GirlfriendGPT personality!
